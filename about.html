          <!-- <p>We turn what seems like waste to beauty. We are a committed business that creates beautiful interior decor
            through handcraft. These products are made out of everyday materials that surround us.</p> -->
          <p> (We are different just like you)
            It is said that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder but is this true? Don’t you think our culture and environment has shaped the way we look at things? I was born and raised in a beautiful African village, very friendly people, lots of milk and food but I should admit that one thing I didn’t like about the culture was that they gave too much weight to a factor as shallow as looks. And honestly, whatever they called beauty, I was just the opposite of it. I spent lots of time alone but arts and crafts being part of our tradition, from a young age, I learnt to do a lot with my hands from molding images with clay or even mud, making jewelry with beads, cloths etc. I found so much comfort here. I made objects, images out of clay and mud and most times I found them beautiful in my eyes just like God, in His sovereignty created the things that we see and said that it was all good. 
            God has formed every one of us, He has made us with his very own hands He formed man from the dust of the earth, we may be different, look different, shaped different but we are beautifully made. With my hands I have learnt to use the available local resources to create and make beautiful artistic pieces. Making implies a direct relationship between the object and the maker. Every piece has a specific meaning because it is made with so much emotion, strength and thoughtfulness. 
             Different just like you! </p>
